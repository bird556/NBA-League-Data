## Lessons Learned

### What did you learn while building this project?

- Proptypes & Components

- getServerSideProps ([ link id context])

- How to add class to an active nav link (underlined white on active tab)

- useEffect, useRef, useState hooks

## What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- Took me a while to fully grasp getStaticProps, getServerSideProps etc (nextjs) but after watching some videos and going back to my udemy courses I got it figured out.

- Hiding API key, I already knew how to use .env but not for nextjs because if I didn't use getStaticProps or getServerSideProps etc. My key would be undefined & I wouldn't be able to fetch my data from the api but I got it 😉

- I put the key ID into the parent & into the children 😅 which it should be only into the parent but I went through my code & fixed it.
